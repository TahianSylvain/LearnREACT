To install a specific version of TensorFlow.js on Ubuntu, you can use npm (Node Package Manager) to specify the version you want during installation. Here are the steps to install TensorFlow.js version 3.0.0:
AAAA
1. **Install Node.js and npm**: If you don't already have Node.js and npm installed on your Ubuntu system, you can do so by running the following commands:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install nodejs npm
   ```

2. **Install TensorFlow.js**: You can use the `npm` command to install TensorFlow.js and specify the version you want:

   ```bash
   npm install @tensorflow/tfjs@3.0.0
   ```

   This command will install TensorFlow.js version 3.0.0 and its dependencies.

3. **Verify the Installation**: To verify that TensorFlow.js has been installed correctly, you can create a simple Node.js script that imports TensorFlow.js and checks its version. Create a JavaScript file (e.g., `check_tfjs_version.js`) with the following content:

   ```javascript
   const tf = require('@tensorflow/tfjs-node');

   console.log('TensorFlow.js version:', tf.version.tfjs);
   ```

4. **Run the Script**: Execute the script using Node.js:

   ```bash
   node check_tfjs_version.js
   ```

   This should print the version of TensorFlow.js, which should be "3.0.0" if the installation was successful.

Please note that TensorFlow.js 3.0.0 is the version available as of my last knowledge update in September 2021. If there have been newer releases since then, you can replace "3.0.0" with the desired version number when using the `npm install` command. Always check the official TensorFlow.js documentation or GitHub repository for the most current version information and installation instructions.

BUT: Many modern browsers have built-in support for GPU acceleration through WebGL
	```npm install @tensorflow/tfjs-node-gpu```
